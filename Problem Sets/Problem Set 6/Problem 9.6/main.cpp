// 9.6 (Rational Class) Create a class called Rational for performing arithmetic with fractions. Write a program to test
// your class. Use integer variables to represent the private data of the class— the numerator and the denominator . Provide a
// constructor that enables an object of this class to be initialized when it’s declared. The constructor should contain default
// values in case no initializers are provided and should store the fraction in reduced form. For example, the fraction 2/4
// would be stored in the object as 1 in the numerator and 2 in the denominator . Provide public member functions that perform
// each of the following tasks:
// A. add —Adds two Rational numbers. The result should be stored in reduced form.
// B. subtract —Subtracts two Rational numbers. Store the result in reduced form.
// C. multiply —Multiplies two Rational numbers. Store the result in reduced form.
// D. divide —Divides two Rational numbers. The result should be stored in reduced form.
// E. toRationalString —Returns a string representation of a Rational number in the form a/b , where a is the numerator and b is the denominator.
// F. toDouble —Returns the Rational number as a double .
// In Chapter 10, you’ll learn how to overload +, -, *, / and << so you can write expressions like a + b , a-b , a*b , a-b and
// cout << a to add, subtract, multiply, divide and output Complex objects.
