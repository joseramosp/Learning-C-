* Final Project
---------------------------

* Objective:

This is a chance to show off anything you want. You can continue add to risk or you can make something totally new (COVID-19 infection simulator?). I just want to see what you can do with all we have covered.

* NOTE: 

I decided to do a COVID-19 Simulator.

In order to run the graphics, make sure you have the working directory set as the project folder.

The most difficult part was doing the UI and reading the documentation of the SFML. I learned that SFML doesn't have a button class, so I had to create my own.

I downloaded the SFML library from here -> https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/csfml/
